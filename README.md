# AI-Capstone-Project-with-Deep-Learning-
This is a deeplearning capstone project by IBM: https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-deep-learning-capstone/ 
In this project the aim is to perform a binary classification to differentiate between walls with and without cracks.
Pytorch has been used to first build a classification model from scratch and second to use transfer learning by importing Resnet18.
The notebooks have details about how to load, organize and prepare data in order to use it for classification in Pytorch framework.
